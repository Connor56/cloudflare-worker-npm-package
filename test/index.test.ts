/**
 * The test file for index.ts.
 * 
 * A nice way to write tests is the following:
 * 
 * 1. Copy the layout of your src folder.
 * 2. Every module ending in `.ts` create a corresponding test file ending in `.test.ts`.
 * 3. Write tests for each function in the module.
 * 
 * This mirrored structure keeps things organised and simple.
